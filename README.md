# Apple_Stock_price-_Forecast
# Objective: Develop a time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on historical stock price data.

A time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical data. This project leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze trends, patterns, and market fluctuations for accurate price predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and scaled stock price data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends, seasonality, and correlations
Feature Engineering: Created lag features, moving averages, and technical indicators
Model Building: Implemented ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, and Prophet for forecasting
Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Time Series Models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet)
Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU - TensorFlow/Keras)
Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
This project aids investors and analysts in making data-driven stock market decisions by forecasting future stock prices with high accuracy. ðŸš€
